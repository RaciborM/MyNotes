## Project Reflection

This project was built during my Masters. It was my addicional learning and projects in web application sector.

The main goal of the project was to create a web application using JavaScript for taking notes. The application is designed so that all notes are visible and color-coded into specific categories (shopping, wor, others).

The project helped me consolidate my existing knowledge and gain experience in writing code in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
